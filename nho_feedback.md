### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice job meeting an achievable scope for your first project. I liked how you came up with an appropriate bronze, silver, and gold and would've liked to see your original sketches, ideas for how the game would look. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, relevant wireframes, and user stories.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! You clearly identified the problem and came up with a functional game in less than 100 lines of code, pretty sweet! I like how it looks like you had fun with this and picked a theme you liked!

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Please review my [inline code comments here](https://github.com/Robizzy27/project1/compare/master...nolds9:feedback) (prefixed with my initials - "NHO") for suggestions to help improve code quality.  Moving forward, I recommend working to break down your code into more modular blocks, taking a more object-oriented approach, using Atom's `Beautify` package to help with code indentation, and I would encourage you to continue leaving code comments.

* __Problem Solving__:

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Nice work on this project! In general, I would like to see more evidence of your struggle through a problem, whether that be through more user stories, code comments, or more commits and would like to see you come up with ways to brainstorm adding more features in your wish-list!
